# About This Project: OpenStreetMap Tile Server

This repository offers a step-by-step guide for deploying your own OpenStreetMap (OSM) tile server using Docker on Ubuntu. Whether you’re a system administrator, GIS developer, researcher, or open-source mapping enthusiast, this project enables you to reliably host and serve OSM map tiles for a wide range of geographic applications—locally or across your network.

## Project Purpose

**Host and render OSM map tiles** for use in geographic applications, internal mapping tools, or research projects.

## Key Features

- **Docker-based deployment:** Ensures reproducibility, isolation, and ease of management.
- **Regional OSM extracts:** Supports targeted deployments (e.g., Australia or other regions).
- **Detailed setup & troubleshooting:** Includes instructions for database setup, style configuration, and common issues.
- **Flexible access:** Designed for both local and networked use.
- **Example scripts & templates:** Facilitates automation and workflow customization.

## Audience

- System administrators
- GIS developers
- Researchers
- Open-source map enthusiasts

## Repository Structure

- **SETUP.md:** Step-by-step deployment instructions.
- **osm-docker/osm-data/:** Contains OSM data, map styles, rendered tiles, and database files.
- **(Optional) docker-compose.yml:** Orchestrates services for streamlined deployment.
