# OpenStreetMap Tile Server

This project provides a robust, step-by-step guide and supporting resources for deploying an OpenStreetMap (OSM) tile server using Docker on Ubuntu. The goal is to enable anyone to reliably set up, manage, and maintain their own OSM tile server for serving map tiles locally or over a network.

## Project Overview

- **Purpose:**  
  Host and render OSM map tiles for geographic applications, internal tools, or research.
- **Features:**  
  - Uses Docker for reproducible deployment.
  - Supports regional OSM extracts (e.g., Australia).
  - Includes instructions for style configuration, database setup, and troubleshooting.
  - Designed for local and network access.
- **Audience:**  
  System administrators, GIS developers, researchers, and enthusiasts needing open source map infrastructure.

## Contents

- [`SETUP.md`](SETUP.md): Step-by-step deployment instructions.
- `osm-docker/osm-data/`: Stores OSM data, map styles, rendered tiles, and database files.
- (Optional) `docker-compose.yml`: For orchestrating services.
- Example scripts and templates (see repo).

## Quick Start

1. Review and follow [`SETUP.md`](SETUP.md) for detailed installation and configuration.
2. Prepare your VM and install dependencies.
3. Download the required OSM extract and style files.
4. Import data and launch the tile server with Docker.
5. Access your map tiles via browser or GIS clients.
